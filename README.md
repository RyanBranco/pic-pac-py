Play Tic Tac Toe in your terminal. (written with python 🐍)

My first python project (no online tutorial necessary), so this all came from my little brain 🧠 😄.

This is when the big "ah ha!" moment arose at the start of my software engineering journey.

I would recommend replicating this project if you are seeking to understand the basics of python.
